Project:
LogAnalyzer

Progress:
++--------------------------------------| 5% 

Purpose:
Sumo has provided powerful analysis for logging already. However, looking into every disconnection is tedious and time consuming. For advanced analysis to quickly screen the disconnection events, the project aims to pull the data into python and make proper visualization to assist the analysis. 

Strategy map:
1) disconnection time chart, with layer-based division. 
2) label normal, abnormal and TBD region. 
3) based on open source apis: matplotpy 
4) Using the simplest data structure now and optimize 
5) Complicated machine learning ? Feature collection ? time-average counts of keywords ? 

Examples: 
1) viz of disconnections
